A slightly less lame version of the gnome-games klondike program by
making the program more game aware. 

Cards are moved up to the foundation if possible whenever a new card
is exposed. In some rare cases you may want to move the card moved
back down. 

Also the game is over when all cards have been exposed and there is at
least one redeal left. (This condition assumies the stock is exposed
one card at a time which is the default rather than the more
traditional skipping two).

To install just find klondike.scm and replace it with the version
found here.
